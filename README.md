# Recursive Matrix Determinant Algorithm

This repository presents an algorithmic example demonstrating the recursive
computation of a matrix determinant for square matrices of arbitrary order.

## Overview

Computing the determinant of a matrix is a classical mathematical problem
with practical applications in scientific computing, numerical analysis,
and data processing pipelines.

In this project, the determinant is calculated using a **recursive expansion
approach**, designed to work for matrices of any size, not limited to fixed
dimensions.

The initial prototype of this algorithm was developed and validated using
Excel as a conceptual and numerical testing environment, before being
abstracted into a general algorithmic form.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Recursive algorithm design
- Translation of mathematical formulas into executable logic
- Handling arbitrary matrix sizes dynamically
- Algorithmic thinking applied to real-world data problems

## Why Recursion?

Recursion provides a clear and expressive way to define determinant
computation based on smaller sub-matrices (minors). While not always the most
performance-optimal approach for very large matrices, it is ideal for:

- Algorithmic clarity
- Educational and analytical use
- Prototyping and validation of mathematical logic

## Practical Relevance

This type of logic is commonly required in:
- Scientific and engineering software
- Data-intensive backend systems
- Numerical preprocessing for simulation models
- Custom analytical tools where built-in libraries are not available

## Repository Contents

- Conceptual algorithm description
- Mathematical logic expressed in a structured, implementation-ready form
- Prototype calculations validated using Excel
